# Functional testing

Here are a list of things that should be manually tested after big refactors.

## In a direct message with Gastitis:
- `/total` should show the total expenses so far.
- `/m` should show the total expenses for this month.
- `/g` should save a new expense.
- `/total` and `/m` should show the total expenses updated.


## In a group with Gastitis and other people:
- `/total` should show the total expenses so far and the debt between the users.
- `/m` should show the total expenses for this month.
- `/g` should save a new expense.
- `/p` should save a new payment.
- `/total` and `/m` should show the total expenses updated.
